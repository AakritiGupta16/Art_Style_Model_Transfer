# Artistic Style Model Transfer
This is a Jupyter Notebook as part of my submission for the role of Engineer, Generative AI at Dashtoon. 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for creating an artistic style transfer model using deep learning. The model is designed to capture the artistic style of one image and apply it to another, blending the style of the former with the content of the latter.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you will need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow (Preferably the latest version)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

### Installation

First, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

Then, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pillow
```

### Running the Notebook

Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook model.ipynb
```
